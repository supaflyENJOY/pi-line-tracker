# OpenCV line tracker
Repository won't have updates.
This code was used for competition that was placed in Kharkiv, NTU KHPI 12-14 of April.
To increase speed you need to update MAX_POWER variable + compute some values for pidK1, pidK2, pidK3. 
Maybe, you will need to change modifier at line 108 in Main.py
